* Visual feedback required when word is submitted and when response is received
	(especially if the response returned nothing)
	
* styling for right side panel

* what do I do if the game runs over 60 mins? end game?

* word lookup backwards and forwards depending on snake direction? 
	NO - just rely on the word displayed in the bottom panel rather than the (possibly reversed)
	word shown on the snake
	
* can snake cross itself to create loop words or to do lookups where the letter
	at the crossed position is G/A (has two options)
	NO - looped words are too difficult because which direction do we read them in?
	we are relying on the bottom panel displayed word for this reason
* alternatively, should snake die when crossing itself?

* style notes
	- bottom panel word could be longer than bottom panel
	
* the more letters we are looking up, the longer it might take. (Can't assume the user has
	done any previous lookups). Unless we automatically trigger background lookups every
	now and then without committing the words, to cover for users who may not regularly
	hit enter
	
* to actually be a game the size of the board should be predefined not just based on
	what fits nicely on the screen
